It avoids a number of common traps for measuring execution times.\nThis can be achieved through the command line interface and the Python interface.\nHere only talk about the python interface.\nPython Interface The module defines three convenience functions and a public class:\n timeit.timeit(stmt='pass\u0026rsquo;, setup='pass\u0026rsquo;, timer=, number=1000000, globals=None) timeit.repeat(stmt='pass\u0026rsquo;, setup='pass\u0026rsquo;, timer=, repeat=5, number=1000000, globals=None) timeit.default_timer() class timeit.Timer(stmt='pass\u0026rsquo;, setup='pass\u0026rsquo;, timer=, globals=None)  timeit.timeit() Create a Timer instance with the given statement, setup code and timer function and run its timeit() method with number executions. The optional globals argument specifies a namespace in which to execute the code.\ntimeit.repeat() Create a Timer instance with the given statement, setup code and timer function and run its repea() method with the given repeat count and number executions. The optional globals argument specifies a namespace in which to execute the code.\n Changed in version 3.7: Default value of repeat changed from 3 to 5.  timeit.default_timer() The default timer, which is always time.perf_counter().\n Changed in version 3.3: time.perf_counter() is now the default timer.  class timeit.Timer Class for timing execution speed of small code snippets.\nThe constructor takes a statement to be timed, an additional statement used for setup, and a timer function. Both statements default to \u0026lsquo;pass\u0026rsquo;; the timer function is platform-dependent (see the module doc string). stmt and setup may also contain multiple statements separated by ; or newlines, as long as they don’t contain multi-line string literals. The statement will by default be executed within timeit’s namespace; this behavior can be controlled by passing a namespace to globals.\nTo measure the execution time of the first statement, use the timeit() method. The repeat() and autorange() methods are convenience methods to call timeit() multiple times.\nThe execution time of setup is excluded from the overall timed execution run.\nThe stmt and setup parameters can also take objects that are callable without arguments. This will embed calls to them in a timer function that will then be executed by timeit(). Note that the timing overhead is a little larger in this case because of the extra function calls.\n Changed in version 3.5: The optional globals parameter was added.  timeit(number=1000000) Time number executions of the main statement. This executes the setup statement once, and then returns the time it takes to execute the main statement a number of times, measured in seconds as a float. The argument is the number of times through the loop, defaulting to one million. The main statement, the setup statement and the timer function to be used are passed to the constructor.\n Note\nBy default, timeit() temporarily turns off garbage collection during the timing. The advantage of this approach is that it makes independent timings more comparable. The disadvantage is that GC may be an important component of the performance of the function being measured. If so, GC can be re-enabled as the first statement in the setup string. For example:\ntimeit.Timer('for i in range(10): oct(i)', 'gc.enable()').timeit()\n autorange(callback=None) Automatically determine how many times to call timeit().\nThis is a convenience function that calls timeit() repeatedly so that the total time \u0026gt;= 0.2 second, returning the eventual (number of loops, time taken for that number of loops). It calls timeit() with increasing numbers from the sequence 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, … until the time taken is at least 0.2 second.\nIf callback is given and is not None, it will be called after each trial with two arguments: callback(number, time_taken).\n New in version 3.6.  repeat(repeat=5, number=1000000) Call timeit() a few times.\nThis is a convenience function that calls the timeit() repeatedly, returning a list of results. The first argument specifies how many times to call timeit(). The second argument specifies the number argument for timeit().\n Note\nIt’s tempting to calculate mean and standard deviation from the result vector and report these. However, this is not very useful. In a typical case, the lowest value gives a lower bound for how fast your machine can run the given code snippet; higher values in the result vector are typically not caused by variability in Python’s speed, but by other processes interfering with your timing accuracy. So the min() of the result is probably the only number you should be interested in.

The method is derived from PEP 498 – Literal String Interpolation, is designed to make the operation of formatting string more concise.f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with \u0026lsquo;f\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;F'(like f\u0026rsquo;xxx\u0026rsquo; or F\u0026rsquo;xxx\u0026rsquo;).

So care must be taken as to which is preferred, depending on which one is the longest set and whether a new set is needed.\nTo perform set operations like s-t, both s and t need to be sets. However you can do the method equivalents even if t is any iterable, for example s.difference(l), where l is a list.\n dict The Average Case times listed for dict objects assume that the hash function for the objects is sufficiently robust to make collisions uncommon. The Average Case assumes the keys used in parameters are selected uniformly at random from the set of all keys.\nNote that there is a fast-path for dicts that (in practice) only deal with str keys; this doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the algorithmic complexity, but it can significantly affect the constant factors: how quickly a typical program finishes.\n   Operation Average Case Amortized Worst Case     Copy[2] O(n) O(n)   Get Item O(1) O(n)   Set Item[1] O(1) O(n)   Delete Item O(1) O(n)   Iteration[2] O(n) O(n)    Notes [1] = These operations rely on the \u0026ldquo;Amortized\u0026rdquo; part of \u0026ldquo;Amortized Worst Case\u0026quot;.
